This project was built using React Native as frontend and Flask as the backend. The major library utilized in its production is SocketIO. The server for this project is hosted on Heroku, therefore there might be a slight delay when first creating a room to play.

This project is still a work in progress and will continue to be updated.

The Rules for the game can be found by clicking the "Rules" button.
